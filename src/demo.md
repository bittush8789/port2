Developed a scalable log analysis solution leveraging AWS CloudWatch Logs to streamline troubleshooting, monitoring, and operational insights. The tool automates log aggregation, filtering, and visualization, reducing manual effort for DevOps teams.
Automated Log Processing: Integrated with AWS Lambda and CloudWatch Logs Insights to parse and analyze logs in real-time, identifying patterns (e.g., errors, latency spikes) 14.
AI-Powered Analysis: Enhanced log interpretation using AI models (e.g., Amazon Q CLI) to generate actionable summaries and correlate events across services 18.
Elasticsearch Integration: Configured on-demand Elasticsearch clusters via Lambda to analyze historical logs exported from S3, enabling ad-hoc queries without maintaining persistent infrastructure 4.
Multi-Tool Compatibility: Supported workflows with tools like saw (CLI for CloudWatch Logs) and MCP servers for AI-driven log correlation, enabling seamless integration into existing DevOps pipelines.
